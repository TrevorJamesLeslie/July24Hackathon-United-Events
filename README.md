## UX

### Colour Scheme

We've used CSS for the colours to simplify switching theme colours quickly (if necessary).

```css
:root {
    --black: 0, 0, 0; /* #000000 */
    --white: 255, 255, 255; /* #FFFFFF */
    --offwhite: 250, 250, 250; /* #FAFAFA */

    --united-red: 255, 0, 0; /* #FF0000 */
    --united-orange: 255, 127, 0; /* #FF7F00 */
    --united-yellow: 255, 255, 0; /* #FFFF00 */
    --united-green: 0, 255, 0; /* #00FF00 */
    --united-blue: 0, 0, 255; /* #0000FF */
    --united-indigo: 75, 0, 130; /* #4B0082 */
    --united-violet: 139, 0, 255; /* #8B00FF */

    --united-grey-light: 125, 125, 125; /* #7D7D7D */
    --united-grey-dark: 58, 58, 58; /* #3A3A3A */

    --united-primary: 241, 26, 123; /* #F11A7B */
    --united-secondary: 152, 33, 118; /* #982176 */
    --united-tertiary: 0, 101, 119;  /* #006577 */
    --united-quaternary: 255, 201, 83; /* #FFC953 */
}
```

We've used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/f11a7b-982176-006577-ffc953-000000-fafafa) to generate our colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolers.png)


### Typography

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Stories

### Home Page
- As a user, it should be clear what the website is about and its purpose so I know how to navigate it.
- As a user, the home page should provide a link to the page with the calendar with the events in.

### Registration and Login Form (on two separate pages)

#### New user

- As a new user I should be able to navigate to registration page from the home page
- As a new user, when I visit the application’s homepage, I should be able to see an option to register for a new account.
- As a new user, when on the registration page, I should be able to fill out the form with my name, email, and password.
- As a new user, when I have filled out the registration form I should be able to submit the form easily and the system should validate the form fields such as checking for valid email format and password strength etc.
- When the new user submits the form, the system should create a new user account in the database.
- When a new user's account has been created and is successful, the user should see a confirmation message that their account has been created.
- When the new user's account is successful and see's the confirmation message, they should be automatically logged in to their new account each time they log in.
- As a new user when they create their account the system should send a verification email to their registered email address.
- When a new user has received a verification email, their account should be activated when they click on the link to confirm verification.

#### Registered user

- As a registered user, I should be able to log in to their account so I can view and manage their events.
- As a registered user, when I visit the application’s homepage, I should see an option to log in to my account.
- As a registered user, when I am on the login form and enter my email and password, I should be able to submit the form to log in.
- As a registered user, when they submit the form, the system should validate the email and password fields.
- As a registered user, if the form is valid, the system should check their credentials against the database. If credentials are correct, and when the system authenticates me, then they should be logged in and redirected to their account dashboard.
- As a registered user, if they have entered incorrect credentials and the system fails to authenticate me, then they should see an error message indicating invalid email or password.
- As a registered user, if I forget my password, there should be an option to reset my password by receiving a reset link via email.

By breaking down these user stories into more granular steps, you can ensure that all aspects of the user registration and authentication process are covered and can be implemented systematically.

### Events/Calendar Page

- As a user, I should be able to select events I want and be able to register for them.
- As a user, I should be able to navigate around the events page to find events I need so I can view them.
- As a user, I should be able to scroll through the calendar on the events page and click on each event under each date to register for the event.
- As an admin, they should be able to create, update, add, and remove events from the calendar.

### Contact Us Page

- As a user I should be able to fill out the contact us form and to be able to submit it easily without any issues.

### Team Page

- As a user, I should be able to see details of the team members on the team members page so I see their github profile links, linkedIn urls, and how they contributed to the project.

### General 

- As a user, I expect all the links to be working as expected across the website so I don't come across any broken links.
- As a user, I expect the styling to be consistent across the pages so that I everything looks appealing visually.
- As a user, I expect the website to be responsive on all different screen sizes so I can view all content and information easily.
- As an admin, I should be able to update an Event, so that I can maintain a clean database, clean any mistakes, or remove events no longer needed.
- As an admin, I should be able to delete an Event, so that I can maintain a clean database, clean any mistakes, or remove events no longer needed.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
We've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design our site wireframes.

### Unfixed bugs

- ~~Django security issue with vulnerabilities~~
    - PATCHED: updated `Django==4.2.14`

 ![Security issues screenshot](documentation/other-images/bugs-screenshot.png)

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

Below is our ERD using the [Mermaid](https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNqdU8tuwjAQ_BXLZzjQY24VDVJFeQhoT5EiEy9hRWJH9kYUkfx77YaW1oCoaimSMzMez242R55pCTziYJ5Q5EaUiWJuDWfT1eNwxY7dq1-oiKFk8_EZsmRQ5UyJEi5AKAUWZ5TgnVgJ1or8h1YKAsISmAVFHdwmqtvEb_H0XwG8qWOEodRvAwKUDOCTSaEzQahVkFmCzQxWV5gt5tvCPWQDQmSZKxTXWCAdAo4w2wGlqDY6PCUl-ltEkSpNYC8C7mFt8Sv4d5vmi9no-SW-0ygP1RZM6vDROLB4XcaLvzXaW1z92pWwdq-NvDcGa60Lhja1dQXGu92opmn6_abpkkUs4YNokPDfkraTdGPiNZOHidfwHi_BuGulG-vPqhJOW3ChuVdJYXZe1jqdqEkvDyrjEZkaeryu_GScfgQebURhof0A3PfwUg) library.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/hannahro15/projects/3) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and tasks were planned, then tracked on a daily basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](documentation/other-images/kanban-board.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hannahro15/July24Hackathon-United-Events/issues) served as an another Agile tool.

It also helped with iterations on a daily basis.


- [Open Issues](https://github.com/hannahro15/July24Hackathon-United-Events/issues) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/hannahro15/July24Hackathon-United-Events)](https://github.com/hannahro15/July24Hackathon-United-Events/issues)

    ![screenshot](documentation/other-images/open-issues.png)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/hannahro15/July24Hackathon-United-Events/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/hannahro15/July24Hackathon-United-Events)](https://github.com/hannahro15/July24Hackathon-United-Events/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

    ![screenshot](documentation/other-images/closed-issues-2.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

We've decomposed our Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, we were able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to our user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://united-events-a9a097150c85.herokuapp.com).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain our own Postgres Database from Code Institute, we followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using one of our team member's email address.
- An email was sent to them with our new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking our repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hannahro15/July24Hackathon-United-Events)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

There are no major differences between the local version and the deployed version.
